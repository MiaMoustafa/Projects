                When Paul Rand died on November 26, 1996, at eighty-two, his career had spanned six decades, three
                generations, and numerous chapters of design history. In the late 1930s he began to transform commercial
                art from craft to profession. By the early 1940s he had influenced the look of advertising, books, and
                magazine cover design. By the late 1940s he was proffering a graphic design vocabulary based on pure
                form where once only style and technique prevailed. By the mid-1950s he was altering the ways that major
                corporations used graphic identity. And by the mid-1960s he had created some of the world’s most
                enduring corporate logos, including IBM, UPS, ABC, and Westinghouse. He was the channel through which
                European modern art and design—Russian constructivism, Dutch De Stijl, and the German Bauhaus—were
                introduced to American commercial art. His first of four books, Thoughts on Design, published in 1947
                when he was thirty-two, was a bible of modernism. In his later years he was a teacher, theorist, and
                philosopher of design.

                generations, and numerous chapters of design history. In the late 1930s he began to transform commercial

                corporations used graphic identity. And by the mid-1960s he had created some of the world’s most

                “It is in symbolic, visual terms that the designer ultimately realizes his perceptions and experiences;
                and it is in a world of symbols that man lives.” –Paul Rand

                2014 marked Rand’s one hundredth birthday, and on February 25, 2015, the Museum of the City of New York
                opened the first major museum exhibition of his contributions to New York design. Curated by Donald
                Albrecht (I am a co-chair of the show), the exhibition takes off from an earlier solo retrospective at
                the Museum of Design Atlanta (MODA) organized by Daniel Lewandowski, who runs the Paul Rand website
                (paul-rand.com).

                Trained in the commercial art bullpens of New York’s publishing and advertising industries, Paul Rand
                (born Peretz Rosenbaum but Paul Rand was more balanced) was critical of the poor aesthetic standards
                that
                prevailed. He modeled himself on such avant-garde artists as painter Paul Klee, designer El Lissitzky,
                and architect Le Corbusier, each of whom advocated a timeless spirit in design. Adhering to Le
                Corbusier’s dictum that “to be modern is not a fashion, it is a state,” Rand devoted his life to making
                what he modestly called “good work.”
